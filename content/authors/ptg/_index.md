I am an environmental sociologist at Vanderbilt University. My research and teaching address questions at the intersection of structural inequality, development processes, and environmental change. My work engages scholarship in the fields of environmental sociology, environmental justice, climate justice, critical theories of race, energy transitions and technological displacement, and socio-ecological systems. I currently teach Environment and Society, Environmental Inequality and Justice, and The Social Contexts of Public Policy.
