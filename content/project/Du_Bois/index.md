Our field is in the midst of a dramatically reframing its origins in order to acknowledge and incorporate the work that W.E.B. Du Bois put forth to establish our social-scientific discipline. In this project, [Jordan Fox Besek](/author/jordan-fox-besek/), [Brett Clark](/author/brett-clark/), and I highlight that Du Boisâ€™s unique epistemology and positionality led him to grapple with sociological questions that continue to be of interest today to scholars in the field of environmental sociology and justice today. Among these were explorations into the social construction of disaster, the historical co-development of human, non-human animal, and environmental harms, and the development of what would now be called food deserts. Such work, and the interdisciplinary thought, rooted in the Black Radical Tradition, that underpinned it, uniquely positions Du Bois as a model for environmental justice research. In response to challenges such as globalization and climate change, this work suggests that environmental justice and climate justice research must be increasingly multi-causal, multi-scalar, interdisciplinary, and cautious of authority - as [David Pellow](https://www.es.ucsb.edu/david-n-pellow) suggests in his [Critical Environmental Justice Framework](https://bookshop.org/books/what-is-critical-environmental-justice-9780745679389/9780745679389). I argue that Du Bois embodied many of the most valuable aspects of the Black Radical Tradition, and that such an approach will be invaluable to the field of environmental justice studies, and environmental sociology more broadly, as it moves into the future.
