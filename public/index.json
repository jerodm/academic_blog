One of the primary tools used to carry out this reorganization was racialization. The social construction of race facilitated and justified the enslavement of millions of people whose expropriated labor provided the fiber and energy that acted as the foundation of the industrial revolution. At the same time, colonial and settler-colonial processes provided access to resources and markets that were necessary to the ceaseless growth of industrial activity and warfare. These processes played a fundamental role in shaping the infrastructures, built environments, economies, political regimes, trade networks social constructions of race, distribution of resources, and distribution of power that modernity is built upon. In this project my co-author Julius Alexander McGee and I explore the ways in which the histories of slavery and colonization are bound to the seemingly unstoppable inertia of the fossil economy. We use quantitative and historical methods to explore how the processes of colonization, settler colonization, and enslavement set nations on different development pathways in an increasingly globalized economic system. Making a globalized system of production, consumption, and disposal sustainable without also addressing the network of relations that was intentionally built upon racialized logics in order to facilitate mercilessly efficient systems of economic development predicted on the pursuit of growth for growth’s sake may not be possible, and is far from just. This project points to the need for direct intervention in historically entrenched forms of inequality, as well as where such interventions might best be aimed.\n","date":1608076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608076800,"objectID":"3f68a4ee23ed489da51ba81f7d5777f5","permalink":"https://patricktrentgreiner.com/project/historical_inequality/","publishdate":"2020-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/historical_inequality/","section":"project","summary":"Identifies a need for direct intervention in historically entrenched forms of inequality.","tags":["Climate Justice","Sustainable Development","Historical Inequality"],"title":"Colonization, Slavery, and Path Dependencies in the Fossil Economy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As the intensity of environmental change driven by the development of Humanity’s social and economic systems deepens, finding a way to reduce such change becomes ever more urgent. However, it is well acknowledged that the growth-oriented development of systems (i.e. cultural, economic, political) that structure our social relations is ineluctably tied to activities that rely on the extraction of natural resources and exploitation of sinks for the byproducts of our dominant mode of social organization. Identifying the social, political, and economic features of the social world that can move Humanity toward the widely held goals of universal improvements in human well-being and maintenance of earth systems that can support these improvements long into the future is critcally important. In this project, I, and many of my co-authors (Julius Alexander McGee, Christina Ergas, Matthew Thomas Clement, Jordan Fox Besek, Dan Shtob, MacKenzie Christensen, Nathan Pino, and Carl Appleton) use a number of quantitative and historical methods to explore the ways that some improvements in human well-being (e.g. movement toward gender, economic, and racial inequality) re-structure development processes such that they are “decoupled” from environmental change. Put differently, I ask what social changes yield a society that is more equitable, sustainable, resilient, and robust.\n","date":1608076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608076800,"objectID":"2c9835326105b9adc1f6b831aacdd11b","permalink":"https://patricktrentgreiner.com/project/decoupling/","publishdate":"2020-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/decoupling/","section":"project","summary":"What social changes yield a society that is more equitable, sustainable, resilient, and robust?","tags":["Climate Justice","Sustainable Development","Decoupling"],"title":"Inequality, Decoupling, and Sustainable Development","type":"project"},{"authors":["Julius Alexander McGee","Patrick Trent Greiner","Carl Appleton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"b47e36f177c81a635be3220761f0dae7","permalink":"https://patricktrentgreiner.com/publication/prisons/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prisons/","section":"publication","summary":"Increases in incarceration within states are associated with increases in industrial emissions, and that increases in incarceration lead to a more tightly coupled association between gross domestic product per capita and industrial emissions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Locked into Emissions- How Mass Incarceration Contributes to Climate Change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jordan Fox Besek","Patrick Trent Greiner","Brett Clark"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"7d8206994c49199959f9922ed30e5ddc","permalink":"https://patricktrentgreiner.com/publication/dubois_science/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dubois_science/","section":"publication","summary":"Throughout his life, W.E.B.
